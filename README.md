# K-Clustering-Voronoi
A visualization of the K-means clustering algorithm for randomly initialized points across a canvas creates a satisfying Voronoi diagram.

The program can be customised with several parameters:

* noCluster : number of colours/clusters to compute (slower if more)
* noPoint : number of points to be separated into clusters (slower if more)
* ptSize : size of each dot on screen
* ptType : shape of each point drawn = POINT, SQUARE
* initType : shape of working canvas = CIRCLE, RECT

You can also uncomment autoRun() in draw to increment the algorithm using the keyboard manually.
